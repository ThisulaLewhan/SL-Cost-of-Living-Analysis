# 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka Cost of Living Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the trend of the **cost of living in Sri Lanka** over recent years using officially published economic indicators. The objective is to understand how changes in **inflation, fuel prices, and exchange rates** have impacted the overall cost of living and household affordability.

This is a **group-based data analysis project** focused on real-world data cleaning, trend analysis, and insight generation using analytical and visualization tools.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical trends in Sri Lanka’s cost of living
- Identify periods of significant inflationary pressure
- Examine the relationship between fuel prices, exchange rates, and overall cost increases
- Present insights through an interactive and user-friendly dashboard

---

## 📊 Data Sources
The analysis is based on publicly available and credible data sources:
- Consumer Price Index (CPI) – Department of Census & Statistics Sri Lanka  
- Fuel Price Data – Publicly released price revisions  
- Exchange Rate Data (USD/LKR) – Central Bank of Sri Lanka  

> *Note: Category-wise CPI data (e.g., food and non-food) was not available; therefore, the analysis focuses on overall cost-of-living trends.*
